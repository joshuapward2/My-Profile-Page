I've worked in nation-wide corporations to small-town staples.  
                 Over the years I've been able to gain a well-rounded understanding of the fundamentals of business and economics. As well as competenty in interpreting and analyzing asset charts and graphs. I graduated from high school in 2007 and a kinesiology & exercise science program 2012. I've earned a certificate in Full-stack Software Development from the University of Central Florida in 2022.

To name a few...I typically spend my vacations somewhere in the mountains, on a shore with family and friends. My established communication skills and technical fundamentals, combined with a vigorous work ethic, make me a strong addition to any team. My focus is to join a team where I can apply my skills and experience, expand my knowledge and play a part in the next generation of tech. I’m excited to learn and contribute to a team’s success and help others along the way.
