                <span className='textIntro'> Hi, I'm Josh! </span>   <p className='textContent'>I'm a full stack software developer and U.S military veteran. I've spent a large portion of my professional career working in management, hospitality, coaching/training, customer service and sales. From national corporations to small-town staples. From start-ups to established brands. Throughout my career, I've been fortunate to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the fundamentals of business and economics as well as competency in interpreting and analyzing asset charts and graphs. I bring a realistic, multi-faceted, logical and intuitive voice to any team I join. Additionally, I love technology! I'm excited for the technological innovation that awaits ahead. I just want to simply play my part in the process.

                 <h3>Brief timeline with a few accompliments along the way...</h3>
                 I graduated from high school in 2007 as an honor roll student and a captain on the men's varsity basketball team. From there I was given the opportunity to play college basketball at a small Christian school named Trinity college. Where we broke the school record for wins in my freshman season. In 2010 I decided to temporarily leave school and enlist in the United States Marine Corps Reserve. I graduated as a squad leader and a finalist in contention for  the honor graduate. An accolade that's only given to one Marine per graduating class. While still enlisted I decided I wanted to return to school. So I did, and in 2012 I graduated from a kinesiology & exercise science program. It was my honor to be elected class speaker.  From here, I continued my journey into the workforce, holding multiple positions across several industries. In which I was fortunate to gain valuable experience. In 2020, I decided I wanted to make a career change. I wanted to find a career that I was truly passionate about. An industry with opportunity that's consumed with driven, intelligent and passionate minds all working together for a common goal. The decision became clear and without hesitation I began studying. In 2022 I earned a certificate in Full-stack Software Development from the University of Central Florida. I'm actively working to add several more certificates and certifications to my tech stack.

                <h3> Personally...</h3>
                I'm fascinated by nature and I thoroughly enjoy disconnecting in it when time allows. I love to adventure and see the world. Some past-times I enjoy while at home include renovations, reading, puzzles, building websites, cooking and sports. I'm an annual passholder at disney and i go as frequently as possible. I consider myself very fortunate and grateful that I am able to have hobbies, a roof over my head and food on my table. My plan is to one day be able to help those who aren't as fortunate, in any way I can. It brings me joy to see so many companies and individuals contributing to recycling efforts and reducing carbon emissions. I'm an advocate for equal opportunity, medical advancements, responsible tech and education. To name a few... In the words of Voltaire and later famously used by Spidermans beloved Uncle Ben, “with great power comes great responsibility”. A truth that rings loud in times like today.

                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                I believe that with my established communication skills and technical fundamentals, combined with a vigorous work ethic, I’ll make a strong addition to any team. My focus is to join a team where I can apply those skills and experiences, to expand my knowledge and play a part in the next generation of tech. I'm excited to learn and contribute to a team's success and help others along the way.
