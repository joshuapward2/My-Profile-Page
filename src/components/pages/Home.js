                <span className='textIntro'> Hi, I'm Josh! </span>   <p className='textContent'>A Full stack software developer and U.S military veteran. I bring intuitive logic, authentic functionality and creative design to my tech teams.  I've spent a portion of my professional career working in management, hospitality, coaching & training, customer service and sales. I've worked in nation-wide corporations to small-town staples.  
                 Over the years I've been able to gain a well-rounded understanding of the fundamentals of business and economics. As well as competenty in interpreting and analyzing asset charts and graphs. <br></br>I graduated from high school in 2007 as a honor roll student and a captain on the mens varsity basketball team. From there i was given the opportunity to play college basketball at a small christian school named Trinity college. Where we broke the school record for wins in my freshman season. In 2010 i decided to temporarily leave school and enlist in the United States Marine Corps Reserve. I graduated a squad leader and a finalist in the contention of honor graduate. Which is only given to one Marine per graduating class. While still enlisted i decided i wanted to return to school. So i did, and in 2012 i graduated from a kinesiology & exercise science program. From here i continued in the workforce, trying to find my way and make ends meet. Holding multiple positions across several industries. Gaining valuable experience along the way.  In 2020 i decided i wanted to make a career change. I wanted to do something that i not only enjoyed but could afford me the opportunity to help others around the globe. An industry that could really make a difference. With endless opportunities, driven by some of the most intelligent & passionate minds. The decision became clear and without hesitation i began studying. In 2022 i earned a certificate in Full-stack Software Development from the University of Central Florida. I'm actively working to add several more certificate's and certifications to my tech stack. <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Personally, I love to adventure and see the world. Im fascinated by nature and i thoroughly enjoy disconnecting from our busy lives.  Some past-times i enjoy while at home include renovations, cooking and sports.  Im very fortunate and grateful that i am able to have hobbies, a roof over my head and food on my table. My plan is to one day be able to help those who aren't as fortunate, in anyway i can. It brings me joy to see so many companies and individuals contributing to recyling efforts and reducing carbon emissions. I'm an advocate for equal opportunity, medical advancement and education. To name a few...
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                 I believe that with my established communication skills and technical fundamentals, combined with a vigorous work ethic, i make me a strong addition to any team. My focus is to join a team where I can apply those skills and experiences, to expand my knowledge and play a part in the next generation of tech. I'm excited to learn and contribute to a team's success and help others along the way.
