Over the last few years i have spent countless hours learning software development, devops, cloud computing and networking & security from some of the best IT experts this industry has to offer. In addition to apprenticeship i have used the skills obtained to build projects, deploy those projects and troubleshoot those projects. I may not have employed experience but i have carefully curated my time to give myself as much real world experience as possible.  I spent my professional career prior to transitioning to the technology sector working in management, military, hospitality, coaching, customer service, finance and sales. Ive worked in national corporations to small-town staples and start-ups to established brands. Throughout my career, I've acquired a comprehensive proficiency in several point of sale software systems.
