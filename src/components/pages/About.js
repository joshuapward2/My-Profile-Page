      Full stack software developer and U.S military veteran with a background in management, hospitality and customer service.  I have earned a certificate in Full-stack Development from the University of Central Florida. Here, I developed and polished skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Dom manipulation, OOP, React, the MERN stack, MYSQL & NOSQL, PWA’s and several other libraries. I am proficient in the Git and Github work-flow via the command line interface/terminal, as well as the Agile development methodology.  My seasoned communication skills and technical fundamentals, combined with a vigorous work ethic, make me a strong addition to any team. My focus and hope is to join a team where I can apply my skills and experience, expand my knowledge and play a part in the next generation of tech. I’m excited to learn, contribute to a team’s success and help others along the way.
